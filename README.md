## P1graph

[This][http://www.p1graph.org] is my blog containing things I find interesting, mostly on the topics of math, programming, and (studying) 中文.

## Technology

Built using Jekyll hosted on GitHub Pages.

## License

No license (no rights granted) for now. What kind of license do you use for a personal blog/page _anyway_?
