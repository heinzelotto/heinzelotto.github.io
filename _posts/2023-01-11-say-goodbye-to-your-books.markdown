## Send it Into the Unknown?

There are many people who love books. But there are even more copies of good
books than people who read them. Recently I spoke to a friend who enjoys reading
and has accumulated a small library. He told me about his plan to reduce its
size since most of the books he enjoyed reading are now sitting in the shelf and
collecting dust. They are to be given away to friends and strangers so that
others can share his joy in reading these titles.

I like this plan a lot since this act of sharing opens up so many possibilities
for human interaction and a feeling of connectedness. What if the recipient will
themselves pass the book on to someone else? What kinds of discussions between
successive readers of the same copy of a book could come from such exchanges?
What would be the farthest a book could go, could it by great and unforgettable
coincidence and unbeknownst to the previous reader even reach the original owner
again?

Sometimes when buying a used book from the internet, you might find a
hand-written dedication in the cover written by the previous owner that shared a
few thoughts about the book and what things they wished the recipient to
experience during their read-through. Or other times there are margin notes,
doodles, and comments written in the book. All written by people unknown to you
that spent several hours on reading through the same book that they and you
liked enough to pass on to someone else. Who were these mysterious other people?
Hearing what they have to say about the book all of you have read would
definitely make for some awesome discussions.

I also set a goal for myself to give one of my favorite books away and have it
go on as far as possible a journey. And for that, the idea of _passing it on and
on_ should be written in the book at least, or be incentivized in some way. And,
if possible, I want to know what others thought about the book.

Tracking a book and gamifying its journey is a task that can be efficiently
solved by technology. There could be a web app that does just this, acting as
some kind of time-delayed book club on the same copy of a book.

## BookVoyage

The website to send a book on its journey and then follow the path it takes
needs to have two main features. To add one of your books initially, register it
and receive a #BOOK code that you write into the book cover for others to find.
Also add a short explanation on how to use that code on the BookVoyage website
and maybe some personal message to the future readers.

On the other hand you might find a book marked in this way in a public book
shelf or a friend might gift you one. You can then visit the BookVoyage website
and enter the code there to get to this book's public page where the path that
the book took so far is logged along with the previous readers' thoughts about
the book. After your read-through you are welcome to also add your personal
thoughts. The book's code -- which itself is not public and only found in the
book -- enables you to add a comment and log its most recent position on the
world map for others to see.

## Next Steps

This was just an overview over the most basic features of the system. This has
to be implemented now. It will be open source, so feel free to help and provide
suggestions!

Many other feature ideas come to mind: 

* World map of all the current positions of books.
* Notifications when someone logged a comment on a book you owned before.
* Ad-hoc book club: schedule a live video chat with other readers of your copy
  of the book.
* Blind-date-with-a-book section: A list of books near your location that are ready
  to be passed on, containing a short and vague description of the contents each but
  not the titles.
