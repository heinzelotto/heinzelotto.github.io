## I don't like to give stuff into the unknown 

There are many people who love books. But there are even more copies of good
books than people who read them. Recently I spoke to a friend who enjoys reading
and already accumulated a small library. He told me about his plan to reduce its
size since most of the books he enjoyed reading are now sitting in the shelf and
collecting dust. They are to be given away to friends and strangers so that
others can share his joy in reading these titles.
